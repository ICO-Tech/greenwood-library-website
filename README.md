# greenwood-library-website
In this project, I will enhance the Greenwood Library website by adding key content and updates. The goal is to improve its structure, provide clear information to users, and make essential details more accessible. This involves creating and updating files, organizing content, and documenting changes using Git for tracking and collaboration.
